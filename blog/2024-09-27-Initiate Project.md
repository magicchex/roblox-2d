# Purpose
I want to make a 2D game in Roblox with the ease of multiplayer support. I wish to make a JRPG / Turn-Based strategy game.

# What's to come?
* I plan to find a method to use animated images in Roblox Studio
* Make a UI module script that generalizies my workflow for quickly importing or creating new instances of UI elements
* Make a grid system
* Add mobile support

# What I Learned Today
* I learned that the properties of UDim2:
    * Scale is the original percentage value of the parented UI element. It ranges from a 0 to 1. For example, a image takes 25% of the player's screen.
    * Offset is the incremental value. It must be greater or equal to zero. A increase of 5 pixels will move or scale the UI element by 5 pixels on the screen.
